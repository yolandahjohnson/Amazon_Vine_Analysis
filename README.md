# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. Utilizing an Amazon Review dataset, I first used PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. I then used PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset.

I chose analyze the Shoe review dataset.
